# BTS Concert Tickets Purchase System



This is a system where you can purchase concert tickets for one of the most popular K-pop artists, BTS. 
The system lets you select seats from the *UBC Thunderbird Arena* seating chart.
The price of tickets varies on how close to the stage.
There is a quantity limit on tickets to prevent a customer from buying all up.

The users of this system will be anyone who wants to go to a BTS concert.

I am a huge fan of BTS. Every time I want to go to their concert, 
I need to compete with other fans to get better seats. The website sometimes crushes in the middle of buying tickets 
because too many people access it at the same time. 
Thus, I always wanted to create a system where we can buy tickets safely and efficiently.
