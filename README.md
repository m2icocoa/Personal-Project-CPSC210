# BTS Concert Tickets Purchase System


This is a system where you can purchase concert tickets for the most popular K-pop artist, BTS. 
The system lets you select seats from the *UBC Thunderbird Arena* seating chart.
The price of tickets varies on how close to the stage.

The users of this system will be anyone who wants to go to a BTS concert held at UBC.

I have been a huge fan of BTS since I was in junior high school. 
However, as BTS has gained world popularity in recent years, it has been extremely difficult to get tickets for
their concert. 
The ticket-selling website sometimes crushes in the middle of buying tickets 
because too many people access it at the same time. 
Moreover, as they became a global phenomenon, they only hold their concert in a huge stadium, 
but not in a small arena like the one at UBC.
Thus, I decided to create a system where we can buy concert tickets, 
hoping BTS will hold a small concert for UBC students one day.
