# BTS Concert Tickets Purchase System

This is a system where you can purchase concert tickets for the most popular K-pop artist, BTS. 
The system lets you select seats from the *UBC Thunderbird Arena* seating chart.
The price of tickets varies on how close to the stage.

The users of this system will be anyone who wants to go to a BTS concert held at UBC.

I have been a huge fan of BTS.
However, as they gained world popularity in recent years, 
it has been extremely difficult to get tickets for their concert.
The ticket-selling website sometimes crushes in the middle of buying tickets 
because too many people access it at the same time.
Moreover, they no longer hold a concert in small arenas like the one at UBC, 
but only in huge stadiums.
Thus, I decided to create a system where we buy concert tickets hoping that BTS will come to UBC to perform one day.
