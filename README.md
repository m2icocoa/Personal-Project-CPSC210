# Stray Kids Concert Tickets and Merchandise Purchase System

You can buy either tickets or merchandise or both. 
The system lets you select seats from the *UBC Thunderbird Arena* map based on your budget. 
You can also choose what merchandise you want based on your favourite member. 
If you are a member of the fan club, you have access to membership benefits such as limited merch. 
Possible features include various price ranges of seats depending on how close to the stage, 
quantity limit of merchandise per person, and payment system.

The users of this system will be anyone who wants to go to Stray Kids' concert or buy merchandise.

I am a huge fan of Stray Kids. Every time I want to go to their concert, 
I need to compete with other fans to get better seats. The website sometimes crushes in the middle of buying tickets 
because too many people access it at the same time. 
Moreover, on the day of the concert, fans need to line up for hours to get merchandise. 
Thus, I always wanted to create a system where you can efficiently buy tickets and merchandise beforehand.
