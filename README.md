# Stray Kids Concert Tickets and Merchandise Purchase System



This is a system where you can purchase one of the most popular K-pop artists, 
Stray Kids' concert tickets and merchandise. 
You can buy either tickets or merchandise or both. 
The system lets you select seats from the *UBC Thunderbird Arena* map 
depending on how close to the stage and your budget. 
You can also choose merchandise of various kinds such as a light stick, hoodie, poster, etc.
Some merchandise is available for each member of Stray Kids.
There might be a quantity limit for merch each person can purchase.
If you are a member of the fan club, you have access to membership benefits such as limited merch.

The users of this system will be anyone who wants to go to Stray Kids' concert or buy merchandise.

I am a huge fan of Stray Kids. Every time I want to go to their concert, 
I need to compete with other fans to get better seats. The website sometimes crushes in the middle of buying tickets 
because too many people access it at the same time. 
Moreover, on the day of the concert, fans need to line up for hours to get merchandise. 
Thus, I always wanted to create a system where you can efficiently buy tickets and merchandise beforehand.
